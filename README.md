# ComBots-Ethics
Small Github for the stand-alone pronoun extraction project, based on a simple greeting script

## Files:
File  | Description
------------- | -------------
README.md | This readme file
pronoun_extraction_script.py | The file that will hold the final script and will provide a demo of the system
pseudo_code.py  | Gives a general overview of the defined functions and their defined outputs
run_tests.py | Script to compare the system with a visual baseline system based on a test csv
toy_example_pronoun_detection.py | The first toy example of the NameAPI workings
text_to_pronouns.py | Script to extract the pronouns out of a greeting sentence, including some examples

## API key:
The project makes use of the NameAPI.org API. A key can be obtained here: https://www.nameapi.org/en/register/

## Data:
The data folder contains a sample csv file that shows our data stucture and a subfolder with pictures mentioned in that csv file. The full dataset will not be share due to it containing sensitive information, but it was collected from several tv-shows ("Hij is een zij", "Are you the one?", "Genderquake"), from social media, via VU pride via a questionnaire, and extended with fake data in the form of pictures with a gender neutral name.
